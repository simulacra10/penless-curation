# 🎙️ Captain Contrary’s Monthly Dispatch

Welcome to this month’s curation from **Captain Contrary** —  
where mainstream narratives get a second look and alternative voices are amplified.  

Inside this digest you’ll find:
- 📜 Articles that challenge assumptions  
- 🎥 Videos worth your time (not your attention span)  
- 📝 Blogs and essays that spark new lines of thought  

Every item is hand-picked, tagged, and archived for clarity — not hype.  
Use the tags to jump between topics and revisit sources later.
